A.R.I. Phase 1-1
Notification
 A text comes in from Calypso to the team.

“Have a job for you, my dears.  It’s a job that requires a more delicate touch.  The Johnson has requested Havoc specifically.  The meet is scheduled at the Broken Stallion at 8pm in room 3 on November 6th.”

Mr Johnson: 
An agent of the Draco Foundation.  He is a well dressed human of German descent, brown hair, brown eyes, slightly pale skin color.  He is wearing a nice pinstriped suit with matching fedora. The Johnson is sitting at the table with a dark leather open briefcase.  He is flanked by a pair of similarly dressed orks.
(Memory checks 3 hits - remember that Walker and Tatters have worked for him before in the Tir)

Job:  
There is a set of data chips that hold research notes on an artifact that the Draco Foundation is interested in.  The research notes are kept in Wuxing Tower and believed to be on the 63rd floor in a secured section.  These data chips are to be retrieved and a set of duplicate data chips, with fake research notes, put in their place.  There should be no evidence that there was any tampering. There is a two week window available for this job.

Pay:  	
25,000 nuyen each 
	Additional 5,000 nuyen with successful negotiation

Building Details:
Wuxing Tower is located in Downtown San Francisco. The 63rd floor is a research and development floor, with the 62nd and 64th floors being wage slave cubicle farms.  There is one freight elevator that goes to this floor, the other one bypasses from 62nd to 64th.  The only other entry point is the stairs.  Entry to get on the 63rd floor, both the elevator and stairs, requires biometric scans.  Biometric scanners, along with all other devices, terminals, etc, are hardwired and not wireless.  The 63rd floor is completely sealed off from the rest of the building.  Only a limited number of individuals have access to the 63rd floor.

Security and Facility Operations:
*Wuxing corpsec provides around the clock onsite security and rotate every six hours.  HTR response time is less than two minutes.  
*Building facilities services are contracted out to Primewell Services.  Contractors do not have access to the 63rd Floor.
*Mana Barrier (Force 8) surrounding the 63rd floor
*Astral Security along with heavy physical security

Wuxing Tower Matrix Host
Host Rating 10
Firewall 13	Attack 	12	Sleaze 11	Data Processing 10	
IC:
Patrol IC: Matrix Perception (10+10 [10]) -- Identify unauthorized icons
Probe IC: Attack: 10 + 10 [10] vs Intuition + Firewall -- The task of Probe IC is to mark intruders for other IC. Every successful “attack” means another mark for the host and its IC on the target, up to the maximum of three marks.
Tar Baby: Attack: 10 + 10 [10] vs Logic + Firewall -- The Tar Baby IC link-locks you when it hits. If you’re already link-locked, it puts a mark on you, up to a maximum of three marks.
Track: Attack: 10 + 10 [10] vs Willpower + Sleaze -- Track IC follows the datastreams between your icon and your deck. If this IC hits and the host has two marks or more on you, the host (and its owners) discover your physical location, which is usually reported to real-world authorities immediately.
Black IC: Attack: 10 + 10 [10] vs Logic + Firewall -- Black IC is the most feared intrusion countermeasures program on the market. The hosts that run it don’t want you repelled—they want you dead. When it hits, Black IC link-locks you. It also causes (Attack) DV Matrix dam- age (+1 DV per net hit and +2 DV per mark on the target) along with an equal amount of biofeedback damage.


Protocols:
The Patrol IC will detect every 8 turns.
Probe IC will be launched to mark intruders
Tar Baby launched to link-lock intruders
Black IC launched to kill intruders

Additional PayData:
*There is an opportunity to erase the bounty on Acorn that Wuxing had placed.  During the legwork and Matrix digging, Tatters will come across the file for the bounty.  The file instructs that any who turn in the bounty, along with Acorn, are to be detained and taken to Section 42.



*Team Edge Test -- Each member searching for stuff makes an Edge roll. Total successes grants below:

00 Successes -- No further items found
01 Success     -- Additional pay data found (~5k nuyen in value)
02 Successes -- Assortment of credsticks found (14k nuyen)
03 Successes -- Spell Formulae found (2 spells that are unknown)
04 Successes -- Polished steel case with cyberears (~43k nuyen in value)
05 Successes -- Additional assortment of credsticks (60k nuyen)
+1 Successes -- Additional 5k nuyen on credsticks
Glitch -- Subtract 1 from total successes
Critical Glitch -- Subtract 1 from total successes and alert security

Twists:
1. The bounty hunter Dog shaman will make a run at acquiring Acorn.  Once she, and another player ideally, are separated from the group, they will make their move.

2. The rogue ice mage will strike as the team is on the road.  She will manifest on the freeway and blast out an ice sheet along the road, causing a major accident.

Fallout:
This is part one of Phase One of the Alcatraz Reclamation Initiative.  As such, it will identify the artifact that will need to be acquired in order to proceed with the plan.  This Johnson will reach out to Havoc again to reclaim the artifact.

If evidence of tampering is found, then the security on the artifact (Phase 1-3) will be extraordinarily high.


Secondary Host
Primewell Services provides nearly all of the facilities services for the tower.

Primewell Services Matrix Host
Host Rating 5
Firewall 8	Attack 	6	Sleaze 5	Data Processing 7


Dog and his Gang:
Mad Hatter will arrive in Host with Tatters to attack him.  The technomancer will launch a full on attack on the decker and get the Host’s attention before jacking out.

Meanwhile, Dog and a pair of drones will launch an attack on Acorn and whichever character is with her using a sniper rifle with stick n shock ammo. 


Rogue Technomancer:
Whether Wuxing has a techno that went rogue or one decided to attack the host while the team is performing the run, an army of sprites invade the host.  This triggers high Matrix security and IC deployment.  Will also attack Tatter's deck at random times.  Fearing another Renraku incident, GOD orders HTR and a Thor Shot to keep the anomolies from spreading to other grids.
