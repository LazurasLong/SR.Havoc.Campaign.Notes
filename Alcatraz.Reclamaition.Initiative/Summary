Alcatraz Reclamation Initiative
CFS government is looking to reclaim Alcatraz Island and to make it a federal prison again.  It has contracted Draco Foundation officials to manage this task, however, the operations run by the Draco Foundation are to stay out of the public eye.  

Officially, CFS is reclaiming the island to neutralize the threats that reside there.  
Unofficially, CFS and Draco Foundation want to use the island as a prison for Awakened metahumans and rogue spirits.

The initiative will be in six phases.

Phase 1 
Identify a way to neutralize the background count, temporarily, to allow access and clean up.  Once this is identified, then the process to do so will need to be completed before phase two.
	-Acquire research notes on artifact that can suppress the background count of an area

Phase 2
With the knowledge of an artifact that could temporarily supress the background count on Alcatraz Island, the item will need to be acquired and tested.
  -The artifact is located somewhere far away ... In an Aztechnology facility
  -The testing can be done on the newly created Background Count in Downtown San Francisco, thanks to the Thor Shot.

Phase 3 
Identify any threats that the prison may hold.  A detailed analysis will need to be done and a catalog of threats created.  Once this information is gathered, a decision will be made on whether reclamation is feasible.
  -This will be using a separate runner team and will not involve Havoc -- unless they fail.

Phase 4 
After approval is gained, disposable assets will be used to eliminate any and all threats on and in the island.
	-Implementation of artifact to reduce background count temporarily
	-Eliminate threats
	-Secure island

Phase 5 
Re-establish Matrix and security to the island.  This will include mana barriers in the cell blocks, turret and drone security and setting up the Alcatraz Matrix host.
	-Removal of artifact or fine tuning to affect only certain areas

Phase 6
Open the island for prisoners.
