Summary
One of the characters, in my game it was Tatters, is assigned to work with a group of Ares CorpSec operatives named Shakespeare.  This works best as a side run for a decker character as only one player is involved and the rest are NPCs.

The team is to acquire information on a top secret project name Project Titan from MCT.  They are developing this project in response to the recent announcement of Knight Errant's ACE units.

Johnson
Sharon Weston, also known as "LaRue" is the Director of Contract Services at Ares Orchard compound in CFS.  She is a young (mid to late 20s) human woman.  Fairly attractive that is 5ft 2in tall, 115lbs, long brown hair and thin wire-framed glasses that cover her bright green eyes.  She is always dressed in a form fitting business suit or dress and has no visible weapons on her.

Job
The job is simple.  Break into the MCT research facility, Building 395, in Palo Alto CFS, Acquire any research and develpment they have and if there are any prototypes.  You will have an aerial insertion and extraction using Shakespeares VTOL and will be escorted by Shakespeare team.  You job is to get the data, theirs is to keep you alive. 

Pay
10,000 nuyen and a Tac-NET rating 1
The team also provides a suit of full body armor, if the character does not already have it.

Building Details
There are 70 floors and the research area is on the 54th floor.  There is an entryway on the roof that requires RFID tags to enter and exit.

Twist
Once the files for the research project are acquired, the prototypes (which you passed by on the way to the research node) activate.  Shakespeare team will need to cover you while you flee to the roof and get extracted.
