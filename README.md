# SR.Campaign.Notes
A place to keep all of my thoughts and ideas for my 5th Edition Shadowrun Campaigns.  

I currently have two campaigns going.  

1.  Havoc Squad that is now based out of New Orleans.  They recently relocated after some events in San Francisco.
2.  A new Motor City campaign with some friends from work ... a sort of office campaign.  This is set in Detroit.

Some of these runs are built specifically for one of the campaigns, however, they can easily be modified to fit nearly any campaign or location.  Furthermore, I will be maintaining a Run Repository with these runs.

Of course, runs that I will be doing for my compaigns will likely not be posted to the site since it will be publically available.  Dont need any spoilers out there ....
