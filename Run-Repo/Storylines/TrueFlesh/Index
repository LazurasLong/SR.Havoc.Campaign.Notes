TrueFlesh -- Dunkelzahn's Will

Per Big D's will

To the first company to create edible synthetic flesh for ghouls, I leave 2 million nuyen with which to develop a complete and diverse product line.

This will be a short story arc consisting of multiple runs and set to be ran with the New Orleans campaign.

Target: Turner Health Advanced Chemical Organization (THACO)
The company has made some substantial strides in developing the use of synthetic flesh and the Draco Foundation is interested in their research.

Run List (to be spread out over a few months of game time)

  [Run 1] Research data steal -- A preservation compound formula (research is a few years old) 
  [Run 2] Extraction of scientist -- Lead scientist and his research
  [Run 3] Research data steal -- Trials using soy-based synthetic materials (all failures)
  [Run 4] Destruction of research facility -- To set back / limit research trials
  [Run 5] Inject research notes -- A possible fix to the failures in secondary facility
  [Run 6] Research data steal -- Trials with injected fix (possible success)

There will be a NewsNet release about a TrueFlesh product being released soon from Advanced Pharmecutical Development Systems (APDS), which is a shell company for the Draco Foundation.
